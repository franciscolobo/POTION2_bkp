Requirements to generate the executable:
* C++ compiler, e.g. GCC 4
* CMake 2.6 (including ccmake) or later recommended, although compilation possible without
* Boost::Spirit, see http://boost-spirit.com/home/
* Reasonably new BLAS implementation (e.g. OpenBLAS, Goto2, ACML, MKL); packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance; recommended: OpenBLAS (http://xianyi.github.io/OpenBLAS/) or Intel MKL
* Reasonably new LAPACK library (e.g. original LAPACK or ACML, MKL); packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance

How to generate the FastCodeML executable:
* Generate BLAS if necessary
* Generate LAPACK if necessary
* Generate NLopt library (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt)
* Edit CMakeLists.txt if necessary
* Set paths for libraries (change and execute SETPATHS)
* "ccmake ." and switch USE_MPI and USE_OPENMP on/off (other default settings should be ok)
* make will create an executable "fast"

Computer system:
* Linux preferred, but sources are portable to other platforms
